# React Primitives

Personal primitive components to start working with React apps.

Primitives are built with an opinionated stack including:

* personal hooks
* react-final-form
* typscript

Of course, we can re-build them with different libraries, and I will explore that.

In this repo, you will find a storybook documenting each primitive component
